## Summary

The Code of Conscience platform is a low-cost cellular and GPS enabled IoT gateway design around the Nordic Semiconductor nRF9160 module. 

This designs shared here provide the foundational electronics design files intended for those individuals and organisations who wish to building smart devices which can ultimately be used to track and prevent rain-forest harvest outside the designated areas or be extended to detect fire within the worlds protected forests.

>This platform has been designed to help enable the people of Brazil and the Amazon rainforest specifically by making it easier to design and fabricate technology which can be used for the protection of this precious resource, "The Lungs of the Earth".

The Code of Conscience Hardware Repository includes the design and manufacturing files for the open source project.
